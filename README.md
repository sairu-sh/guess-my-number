# guess-my-number
A number guessing game using JS. Here a secret random number will be generated and the player will have to guess the number. Player will get 20 chances to guess.
The user will get hints to guess the correct number i.e. if he guessed too high, too low, a littler higher or a little lower. The game will be over once the player
guesses the secret number or when the player runs out of guesses. The player can start again by pressing the "AGAIN!" button at the top.
